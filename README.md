# android-forage-app

This is another app from the Android learning sessions. Android provides the basics for the app to run and we as students fill in the missing pieces based on their guidance and lessons. 

Please see the following description of the app from Android:

"The completed Forage app allows users to keep track of items, food for example, that they've foraged for in nature. This data is persisted between sessions using Room."
